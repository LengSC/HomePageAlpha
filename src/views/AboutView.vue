      <p>
        As he goes through his day, he occasionally encounters fascinating people and intriguing things that truly
        draw him
        in, sparking a desire to <InlineLink to="/links">link</InlineLink> them with others.
      </p>
      <p>

        <br />
        He also enjoys reading <b>science fiction</b>, playing <b>badminton</b> with friends, and sometimes simply
        gazing into space in peaceful <b>reflexion</b>.
      </p>
      <p> Ultimately, he's just an ordinary bloke, content with the little things in life. </p>
